15 hours for week six

This week was finishing the bwt algorithm and creating run-length encoding.
Also some changes were made for the data structures. I was expecting the
run-length encoding to be much simpler task, but it took quite long to
get it to work. The current form of BWT is very simplified, and is too slow
for actual use. The compression ratio seems to be good. Some benchmarking is
in the implementation.md/toteutusdokumentti file.

Next week is implementing sorting and trying to get the bwt into linear time
complexity.

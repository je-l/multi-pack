Around 12 hours used for week 5.

Most of time was used for the Burrows-wheeler this week. It was about as
difficult as expected, no larger problems. The bwt works now, but only with
smaller files. It's also extremely unoptimized now, but making it faster should
be easy with this base. There also is now basic command line arguments.

Next week is improving the bwt, and implementing counting sort for it.

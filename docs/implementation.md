The program consists of a lempel-ziv-welch -module, which has the algorithm
implementation, and serialization functions required by the algorithm.

Data structure module has implementation of hash table and linked list.
Compress module has mostly io and cli functionality in it.

Python is the used project language. It was picked so the project could also be
as an opportunity for using python in more concrete project. C would have been
another interesting choice, but i only know the basics, so the project could
have been too slowed down by the lack of skill.

8 hours spent for week four.

Start of the week was lazy and nothing was done for the project, but starting
from friday there was progress. Hash table and linked lists are now
implemented, and the project structure is somewhat better.

Remaking the project structure was quite time consuming, as the tests wouldn't
run with the same import statements as the program itself.  Making a launcher
file to the source directory parent dir fixed this.

Next week is finally making the bwt, and maybe making a better command line
interface, like new arguments etc.
